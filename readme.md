# Tabia
This repo contains the source code for:
- Tacomin: a miner to find spreadsheet triples that can be used to evaluate Tabia 
- Tabia: a language to combine and integrate spreadsheets

## Tacomin
Tacomin finds spreadsheet triples A, B, C such that A is a combination of 
cells in B and C.

## Ideas
- [ ] Evaluate the triples by calculating fractions of pairs, not only 
    individual cells
- [ ] Sort by this new metric and inspect.
